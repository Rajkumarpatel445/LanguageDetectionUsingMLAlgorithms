# LanguageDetectionUsingMLAlgorithms
This project detects the language of a given text using machine learning. It involves preprocessing multilingual data, feature extraction, and training models like Na√Øve Bayes or BERT. The model accurately classifies text into different languages, useful for chatbots, translation, and text analysis.
